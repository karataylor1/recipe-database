# Overview

This project is to create a SQL relational database in order to further my understanding of SQL and relational databases.

This software can be used to create a database of recipes, where you can add, delete, and retrieve recipes. It uses tables to create the ingredients and instructions. 

By writing this software, I was able to learn about SQL Relational Databases, and how they are used, and then applied that to what I created.

# Relational Database

The structure I created included the tables Recipes, Ingredients, Instructions, and Recipe Instructions. 

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studios Code to create this.

I used sqlite3 in python.

# Future Work

- Retrieving, adding, and deleting from a premade database. 
- Making the code more neat and coherent. 
- Creating a way for users to input their own recipes.
